"""Demo dot product.

This MPyC demo can be run with any number of parties m >= 1.

Each party locally generates two lists of LOAD random integers, and
uses these lists as *private* inputs for the multiparty computation.

All the privately contributed entries are concatenated to form two
secret-shared vectors x and y. The dot product x.y is then computed securely.
